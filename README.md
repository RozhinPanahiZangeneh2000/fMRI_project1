# fMRI_project1
This repository contains an R script for analyzing preprocessed resting-state fMRI data from individuals under the influence of LSD. The analysis focuses on investigating the functional connectivity between the primary visual cortex (V1) and the ventral posterior cingulate cortex (vPCC), which are key regions involved in visual processing and consciousness.
## Dataset  
This analysis uses publicly available fMRI data from:  

**Robin Carhart-Harris et al. (2020). Neural correlates of the LSD experience revealed by multimodal neuroimaging. OpenNeuro. [Dataset]**  
DOI: [10.18112/openneuro.ds003059.v1.0.0](https://doi.org/10.18112/openneuro.ds003059.v1.0.0)  

The dataset is openly available on [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003059) and was preprocessed to control for motion artifacts following standard fMRI preprocessing pipelines. Please cite the original authors when using this data.
